A weekly recap, _a weekcap_, for the 49th week of the year 2022.

Pretty quiet week all things considered. I've managed to keep up with the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles this year even while learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) at the same time. Though, the difficulty has shown a marked increase starting day 07... We'll see how long I can keep it up! You can follow my progress [here](https://github.com/matthewsimo/aoc-2022).

I made this script to download, trim the trailing newline and save your input for the day to help my `init` script &mdash; [get_input.sh](https://gist.github.com/matthewsimo/88a6b494177ec7564516e12bc024ef15) .

> Meet the Princess of the Underworld in HADES II, the bewitching sequel to our award-winning rogue-like dungeon crawler. Details about Early Access coming in 2023.

I started playing the first one at the behest of my brother. It was indeed as awesome as he said and I ended up playing it quite a bit and "got the family back together". Very cool trailer, definitely got us excited.

> Affectionately nicknamed “the book,” The Rust Programming Language will give you an overview of the language from first principles.

Definitely helped me through a few of the advent of code days. As far as language documentation goes, this is a pretty high bar.

<Link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_If%3F_(book)">What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions</Link>

The [XKCD](https://xkcd.com/) guy breaks down some ridiculous questions _with science_. I've had this audiobook on my holds shelf in [Libby](https://libbyapp.com/) for a long time &mdash; it was a fun and engaging listen.
